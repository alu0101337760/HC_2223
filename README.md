# **Hamiltonian Circuit Problem**


## Introuduction

The **Hamiltonian Circuit** problem consist in finding a path in a graph (directed or
undirected) that visits each vertex exactly once.

The aim of this project is to **prove that this problem is NP-Complete**.


## App





## Report



## Implementation

We implemented a **polinomial time transformation** between a _Vertex Cover instance_
and a _Hamiltonian Circuit_, one of the necessary conditions to be np-complete.
